## Executive summary
Operational KPIs fail when they are too numerous or disconnected from leadership priorities. A smaller, trusted set of measures keeps teams aligned and accountable.

## Practical framework
- Anchor each KPI to a decision and an owner.
- Use leading indicators that reflect bottlenecks, not just lagging results.
- Review metrics regularly and retire what no longer drives action.

## What to do next
Run a KPI inventory session to identify redundancies and gaps, then align the final set to monthly operating reviews.
