## Situation
Multiple teams were pursuing automation independently, with limited governance and overlapping tool investments.

## Approach
We ran discovery sessions, scored automation candidates, and designed a governance model for intake, security, and ROI tracking.

## Result
Leadership adopted a 12-month automation roadmap with clear ownership, staged pilots, and a repeatable intake process.
