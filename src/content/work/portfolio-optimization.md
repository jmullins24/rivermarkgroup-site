## Situation
Leadership teams were relying on inconsistent metrics across business lines, making it difficult to prioritize capital allocation and track portfolio health.

## Approach
We ran a KPI alignment workshop, created a single metric dictionary, and assessed the data pipelines supporting credit, deposit, and profitability reporting.

## Result
The bank adopted a shared portfolio scorecard, reduced duplicate reporting, and established a quarterly governance cadence for data quality and metric changes.
