## Situation
Growth in patient volume created bottlenecks across intake, scheduling, and referral coordination. Teams lacked a shared view of capacity and handoffs.

## Approach
We mapped end-to-end workflows, clarified ownership across departments, and introduced weekly operational reviews tied to throughput targets.

## Result
The network reduced intake cycle time, improved referral visibility, and established operational KPIs aligned to leadership priorities.
